## Regex Components
Regular Expression components assist developers behind the scenes. The simple expressions can validate user input, find/replace characters, match positions before, after, trim whitespace, and work between characters. The basic built-in logic improves and simplifies a developers work.  The components also improve the user experience by expanding allowable user input of lower case/upper case/spacing/symbols. Not only does regex validate input, it can automatically update the input to the correct format 'under the hood'.

Regex works with many different programming languages, or engines. There are known as  expression flavors. The flavor highlighted in this tutorial is JavaScript.
