# Fun with Regex

Regular Expression components assist developers behind the scenes. Let's take a peek behind the curtain at the world of 'regex'!

## Summary

Regular expressions are simple 'code snippets' that can validate user input, find/replace characters, match positions before, after, trim whitespace, and work between characters. The basic built-in logic improves and simplifies a developers work. The components also improve the user experience by expanding allowable user input of lower case/upper case/spacing/symbols. Not only does regex validate input, it can automatically update the input to the correct format 'under the hood'.

## Regex Components

Regex works with many different programming languages, or engines. There are known as expression flavors. The flavor highlighted in this tutorial is JavaScript.<br>

### Anchors

Anchors do not match any specific characters at all. Rather they match -before- or -after- whatever you are attempting to match. <br>
>Example: 
```JS
\A\w matches 'a' in abc
```

### Quantifiers



### Grouping Constructs

### Bracket Expressions

### Character Classes

### The OR Operator

### Flags

### Character Escapes

## Author

As a lifelong learner and lover of puzzles, regex is truly fun to learn. Reverse engineering it, creating my own, and trying to solve problems is why I love coding. Regex is the ideal integration into any programming language.
